== ASP.NET Core sample application with Nowin

This is an ASP.NET Core sample application with an Angular frontend. The sample application demonstrates authenticating against the 10Duke Identity Service and querying for user info. The backend is a basic ASP.NET Core application without MVC. It uses https://github.com/Bobris/Nowin[Nowin] as an OWIN web server. Data requests from the browser frontend are handled by a simple OWIN middleware that calls the 10Duke Identity Service for querying user info.
